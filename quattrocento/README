This is the README for the quattrocento package, version 2022-09-13.

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX support for
the Quattrocento and Quattrocento Sans families of fonts, designed by
Pablo Impallari.

Quattrocento is a classic typeface with wide and open letterforms, and
great x-height, which makes it very legible for body text at small
sizes. Tiny details that only show up at bigger sizes make it also
great for display use. Quattrocento Sans is the perfect sans-serif
companion for Quattrocento.

To install this package on a TDS-compliant TeX system download the
file "tex-archive"/install/fonts/quattrocento.tds.zip, where the
preferred URL for "tex-archive" is http://mirror.ctan.org. Unzip
the archive at the root of an appropriate texmf tree, likely a
personal or local tree. If necessary, update the file-name database
(e.g., texhash). Update the font-map files by enabling the Map file
quattrocento.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{quattrocento}

to the preamble of your document. This will activate Quattrocento as the
main (serifed) text font and Quattrocento Sans as the sans font. Italic
variants of Quattrocento are not currently available; artificially
slanted versions have been generated and treated as if they were italic.

To activate Quattrocento without Quattrocento Sans, use

\usepackage[rm]{quattrocento}

Similarly, to activate Quattrocento Sans without Quattrocento use

\usepackage[sf]{quattrocento} 

To use Quattrocento Sans as the main text font, use

\usepackage[sfdefault]{quattrocento}

This re-defines \familydefault, not \rmdefault. LuaLaTeX and
xeLaTeX users who might prefer type1 fonts or who wish to avoid fontspec
may use the type1 option.

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to scale the
Quattrocento Sans fonts; the serifed variants are not affected.

The only figure style supported is proportional-lining. Font
encodings supported are OT1, T1, LY1 and TS1.

Macros \quattrocento and \quattrocentosans select the Quattrocento
and Quattrocento Sans families, respectively.
