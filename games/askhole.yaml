  As seen on www.askhole.io:

  That's a nice social boundary you've got there. Would be a shame if
  something... happened to it.

  Filled with inappropriate, deeply controversial, philosophical, and
  vulnerable inquiries, this deck of unusual questions will keep your night
  full of nervous laughter and your relationships somewhat distressing.

  This is no casual icebreaker deck — use with caution.

  There are 3 suggested ways to play, although you can play any way you want:

  The Askhole (for 3–6 people):
  Appoint an Askhole. The Askhole draws the same number of cards as there are
  people in the group (including the Askhole) and, after looking at them,
  distributes them face down, one per person. One by one, everyone flips their
  card and answers their question — Askhole included. Then choose a new Askhole
  and repeat!

  The Grid (for 2–10 people):
  Place a 5x5 grid of cards face-down on a table, each column consisting of a
  different color/category. Take turns drawing and answering one card at a
  time, Jeopardy!-style, until none remain.

  Social Mixer (for 10+ people):
  Everyone draws one question. When you encounter someone, ask them your
  question, and they ask you theirs. After you both answer, trade questions,
  move along to a new partner, and repeat.
